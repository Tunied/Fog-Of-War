# Unity Fog Of War

**URP Fog of War** => https://github.com/Tunied/CE-FOW-URP

- BuildIn 已经不在维护. 就旧项目一直在用. 这种方案比较麻烦的地方是所有Shader都要重写.
- 另外 如果能升级到 URP 建议直接用URP **Build-In is already history**

### How To Use

#### Init

 fist CopyEngine Fog of War (CEFow) is not extend MonoBehaviour. so you need call 
 
 ```
  CEFowFacade.instance.InitAsNew($propery);
 ```

when the game start.

the $propery you pass in is defined in `CEFowProperty.cs` file. check for more detail in that file.

#### Update

as the CEFow is not extend MonoBehaviour, so you need call 

```
CEFowFacade.instance.Update();
``` 

the frequency of this function called is up to you, you can call it once pre frame or once pre second.

even you can call it only when some explorer changed.

it will not hit any performance issue for call it once pre frame. CEFow will only repaint the Fow texture when something really changed.

#### Explorer

there are two type of explorer , static and not static. check more detail with the demo project.

#### Stalker

CEFow provide a function 

```
CEFowFacade.IsWorldPosInView($worldPosition)
```

let you check is the point in fog or not.

check more detail in `DebugStalker.cs` file
